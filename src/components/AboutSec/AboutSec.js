              Hills, MI is the leading supplier of robots, CNC systems and
              factory automation. Founded in 1982, Robtic has over 1,500

              a Grand Opening of our new 461,000 square-foot facility in Auburn
              Hills, Michigan, in order to keep pace with the growing demand for
              robots and automation. Constructed and in full operation just one
              year after breaking ground, the new facility houses several

              Detroit Free Press for the 10th consecutive year. In addition, the
              Chicago Tribune named Robtic’s Hoffman Estates, IL regional office
              one of Illinois’ top workplaces.
